# 🕒 P00 – Introduction

Welcome to the **Timer App Tutorial**, where you'll learn to build a multi-timer web app using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**. This project is inspired by productivity tools like **Toggl**, and gives you the skills to manage dynamic time-based state in a modern React application.

This app will allow users to:
- ➕ Start and manage multiple independent timers
- ⏸️ Pause and resume timers
- ⏹️ Stop and reset timers
- 🧠 Understand how time updates work in the browser
- 🔄 Store and update state using Redux Toolkit

---

## 🛠️ Technologies You’ll Use
- **React** – Component-based UI library
- **Redux Toolkit** – State management made simple
- **JavaScript** – ES6+ functional programming techniques
- **React Hooks** – `useEffect`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`
- **setInterval / clearInterval** – Real-time updates
- **CSS Modules or Global Styles** – To style the UI (you choose!)

---

## 🧠 Why This App?
- ✅ It's more engaging than a simple to-do list
- ✅ Involves real-time behavior (timing is tricky!)
- ✅ Gives you a foundation in **Redux state + side effects**
- ✅ Helps practice separation of concerns and UI reusability

---

## 🧩 Learning Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to:

✅ Structure Redux state to track timers and updates  
✅ Write clean, reactive components with real-time logic  
✅ Use intervals effectively without memory leaks  
✅ Practice code organization across Redux slices and UI components  
✅ Extend your app with styling, persistence, and filtering

---

## 🔍 What You’ll Build
A **Timer Board** where each timer runs independently. Think:
- A Pomodoro tracker for different tasks
- Multiple stopwatches running in parallel
- Task-based time logging

Each timer will:
- Have a **start time** and **elapsed time**
- Be able to **pause/resume/reset**
- Be displayed and updated live in the UI

---

## 💬 Example AI Prompts
- *"Explain how setInterval is used in a React component."*
- *"Check if my useEffect logic is cleaning up intervals correctly."*
- *"How can I persist timers using localStorage?"*

Use AI to explore, debug, and get code reviews as you go!

## 🚀 Let’s Go!
When you’re ready, continue to **[P01 - Getting Started](01-Getting-Started.md)** and set up your React project.

This is going to be fun. Let’s build something awesome! 🎉
