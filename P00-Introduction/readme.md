# Redux Timers Introduction

The goal of the project is to create a web app that stores a list of timers.

Timers will keep track of elapsed time. The app could be used to track time for billing clients, scientific processes, or other uses. 

Building this app, you will learn how to use React to manage views, and Redux to manage application state. 

While not a complete product, this app has many features that allow you to learn more about JavaScript, React and Redux. It also provides an opportunity to learn more about vanilla JavaScript and takes a close look at the Date Object.

The app created in this tutorial could be the basis of a real world product like [Toggl.com](http://toggl.com)!

# Why is this important?

This gives practice in building web apps using React and getting familiar with the JSX syntax. As you go throughout this course, we'll be building more complex apps, so it's good to have the fundamentals down, which you'll learn in this tutorial!

# Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you should have...

- A basic understanding of JavaScript.
- Familiarity with React and JSX.
- Some understanding of the ES6 version of JavaScript

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to...

1. Build React components using JSX syntax
1. Manage application state using the Flux pattern
1. Use timing methods and objects in JavaScript to accurately track time
1. Use the BEM system to create class names for styling
1. Define class objects and utilize the OOP paradigm

# Using Git/GitHub

Much like we've done in earlier tutorials, make sure you're committing your code as you complete milestones. At a minimum, you should make a commit whenever the tutorial prompts you.

# Set Up Git/GitHub

Set up your repo!

```bash
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'project init'
```

Now go to GitHub and create a public repository, and now associate it as a remote for your local git project and then push to it.

```bash
$ git remote add origin GITHUB-REPO-URL
$ git push origin main -u
```
