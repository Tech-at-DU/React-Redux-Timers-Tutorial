# Web 7 - Timers Tutorial

The Timers app is simular to the core feature of the https://toggl.com. This project is similar Toggle Time Track. This was Toggl's first product. They have since expanded into other products. Toggl Time track is a real world product that is used by many people. 

The app you will be build will create a list of timers that can be used to track time spent on any activity. You could use this to track the time you spend studying, practicing, working. It could be use to track billable hours for work projects. 

The is built from React and Redux. It uses React to display it's UI and and Redux to manage it's appliction state. These two tools are used heavily in industry and well worth learning!
